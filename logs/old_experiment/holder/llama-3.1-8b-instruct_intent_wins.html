For Python-based libraries like scikit-learn, Keras, or TensorFlow.</pre></div><div class="panel intent"><div class="badge low">Intent (USD 0.3939)</div><pre class="output">## Refining Portfolio Website Creation Based on New Instruction  To ensure alignment with the primary goal of creating a portfolio website showing off my projects and blogs, let's revise our strategy given the new focus area of practicing ML interview questions and LeetCode problems. ### Revising Our Approach  Considering we have limited availability of 10-12 hours per week after dedicating some time to studying ML interview prep, we can allocate more time to building out our portfolio site by leveraging existing knowledge and experience in web development and machine learning. Here's how you could structure your content creation process:  #### Content Strategy  *   Allocate dedicated blocks of time each week to build or enhance specific components of your portfolio website. *   Use your existing knowledge of web development to design and implement essential features like navigation menus, responsive layouts, and contact forms. *    For project showcases, consider adding interactive elements where possible, especially if they're relevant to your target ML engineering position. #### Project Showcase Ideas  Some ideas for incorporating ML into your portfolio include:  *   A simple im …</pre></div></div></div>
