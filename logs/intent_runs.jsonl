It usually develops after 20 weeks of gestation and affects both mother and baby. High blood pressure causes damage to organs such as the kidneys and liver, leading to potential complications like premature birth or low birth weight babies. In severe cases, it can even cause seizures or stroke in mothers. Preeclamsia often resolves once the baby is born, but sometimes it persists post-delivery.

However, without additional specifics about the current study, here's how one might approach summarizing findings typically seen in similar trials:  - **Dosage:** A common area of investigation involves determining whether certain medications or supplements effectively reduce the incidence or severity of preeeclampsias symptoms. This may include antihypertensive agents, antiplatelet drugs, omega-3 fatty acids, or other nutritional supplements. - **Timing:** Studies often examine the best window for intervention – before, during, or immediately following delivery. Timing plays a critical role in mitigating risks associated with preeecampasia, including fetal growth restriction and maternal organ dysfunction. - **Population:** Identifying which patient groups benefit most from targeted therapies is essential.
