Aspirin has been investigated as a potential preventative measure. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of low- dose aspirin in reducing preterm preeclamsia risk in high risk pregnancies. **Methods:** A multicenter randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial called the ASPRE Trial enrolled 1777 women at 1st trimester screening who were deemed high- risk. Participants received either 75 mg aspirin or placebo nightly from week 12 to 35 weeks of pregnancy. **Results:** Women receiving aspirin showed a statistically significant 38% decrease in preterm preeclampisa compared to those taking placebo (incidence rate 1. 5% versus 4% respectively, RR 0,38 [CI 0:20 - 0;74], p =. 005). The NNT required to prevent a single case of premature preeclampsia reached 39.

Studies show that taking aspirin at specific times during pregnancy can cut down the risk significantly!  **How Does Aspirin Work?** Doctors believe that aspirin helps protect against preeclampsia because it prevents certain changes in the body that contribute to its development. **Important Information About Taking Aspirin:**  * **Benefits:** Taking aspirin may help reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia and deliver healthy baby. * **Side Effects:** Like any medication, aspirin can cause mild side effects like stomach upset, heartburn, or indigestion. There’s also a small possibility of minor bleeding. But these side effects are usually temporary and don't affect most people. * **Serious Side Effects:** We want to assure you that studies haven't shown any increase in dangerous problems like bleeding in the uterus or brain bleedings in.", "ids": 0.414, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Aspirin has been investigated as a potential preventative measure. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of low- dose aspirin in reducing preterm preeclamsia risk in high risk pregnancies. **Methods:** A multicenter randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial called the ASPRE Trial enrolled 1777 women at 1st trimester screening who were deemed high- risk. Participants received either 75 mg aspirin or placebo nightly from week 12 to 35 weeks of pregnancy. **Results:** Women receiving aspirin showed a statistically significant 38% decrease in preterm preeclampisa compared to those taking placebo (incidence rate 1. 5% versus 4% respectively, RR 0,38 [CI 0:20 - 0;74], p =. 005). The NNT required to prevent a single case of premature preeclampsia reached 39. There was no difference in the incidence rate of term or severe complications like placental abruptions, postpartum hemorrhages, or intracerebral haemorrhage. * **Conclusion:** Low-dose Aspirin administered during late first trimes.", "ids": 0.3609, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Studies show that taking aspirin at specific times during pregnancy can cut down the risk significantly!  **How Does Aspirin Work?** Doctors believe that aspirin helps protect against preeclampsia because it prevents certain changes in the body that contribute to its development. **Important Information About Taking Aspirin:**  * **Benefits:** Taking aspirin may help reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia and deliver healthy baby. * **Side Effects:** Like any medication, aspirin can cause mild side effects like stomach upset, heartburn, or indigestion. There’s also a small possibility of minor bleeding. But these side effects are usually temporary and don't affect most people. * **Serious Side Effects:** We want to assure you that studies haven't shown any increase in dangerous problems like bleeding in the uterus or brain bleedings in.", "ids": 0.414, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Studies show that taking aspirin at specific times during pregnancy can cut down the risk significantly!  **How Does Aspirin Work?** Doctors believe that aspirin helps protect against preeclampsia because it prevents certain changes in the body that contribute to its development. **Important Information About Taking Aspirin:**  * **Benefits:** Taking aspirin may help reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia and deliver healthy baby. * **Side Effects:** Like any medication, aspirin can cause mild side effects like stomach upset, heartburn, or indigestion. There’s also a small possibility of minor bleeding. But these side effects are usually temporary and don't affect most people. * **Serious Side Effects:** We want to assure you that studies haven't shown any increase in dangerous problems like bleeding in the uterus or brain bleedings in.", "ids": 0.414, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}
