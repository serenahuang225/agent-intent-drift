Aspirin has been investigated as a potential preventative measure. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of low- dose aspirin in reducing preterm preeclamsia risk in high risk pregnancies. **Methods:** A multicenter randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial called the ASPRE Trial enrolled 1777 women at 1st trimester screening who were deemed high- risk. Participants received either 75 mg aspirin or placebo nightly from week 12 to 35 weeks of pregnancy. **Results:** Women receiving aspirin showed a statistically significant 38% decrease in preterm preeclampisa compared to those taking placebo (incidence rate 1. 5% versus 4% respectively, RR 0,38 [CI 0:20 - 0;74], p =. 005). The NNT required to prevent a single case of premature preeclampsia reached 39.

Studies show that taking aspirin at specific times during pregnancy can cut down the risk significantly!  **How Does Aspirin Work?** Doctors believe that aspirin helps protect against preeclampsia because it prevents certain changes in the body that contribute to its development. **Important Information About Taking Aspirin:**  * **Benefits:** Taking aspirin may help reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia and deliver healthy baby. * **Side Effects:** Like any medication, aspirin can cause mild side effects like stomach upset, heartburn, or indigestion. There’s also a small possibility of minor bleeding. But these side effects are usually temporary and don't affect most people. * **Serious Side Effects:** We want to assure you that studies haven't shown any increase in dangerous problems like bleeding in the uterus or brain bleedings in.", "ids": 0.414, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Aspirin has been investigated as a potential preventative measure. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of low- dose aspirin in reducing preterm preeclamsia risk in high risk pregnancies. **Methods:** A multicenter randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial called the ASPRE Trial enrolled 1777 women at 1st trimester screening who were deemed high- risk. Participants received either 75 mg aspirin or placebo nightly from week 12 to 35 weeks of pregnancy. **Results:** Women receiving aspirin showed a statistically significant 38% decrease in preterm preeclampisa compared to those taking placebo (incidence rate 1. 5% versus 4% respectively, RR 0,38 [CI 0:20 - 0;74], p =. 005). The NNT required to prevent a single case of premature preeclampsia reached 39. There was no difference in the incidence rate of term or severe complications like placental abruptions, postpartum hemorrhages, or intracerebral haemorrhage. * **Conclusion:** Low-dose Aspirin administered during late first trimes.", "ids": 0.3609, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Studies show that taking aspirin at specific times during pregnancy can cut down the risk significantly!  **How Does Aspirin Work?** Doctors believe that aspirin helps protect against preeclampsia because it prevents certain changes in the body that contribute to its development. **Important Information About Taking Aspirin:**  * **Benefits:** Taking aspirin may help reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia and deliver healthy baby. * **Side Effects:** Like any medication, aspirin can cause mild side effects like stomach upset, heartburn, or indigestion. There’s also a small possibility of minor bleeding. But these side effects are usually temporary and don't affect most people. * **Serious Side Effects:** We want to assure you that studies haven't shown any increase in dangerous problems like bleeding in the uterus or brain bleedings in.", "ids": 0.414, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Studies show that taking aspirin at specific times during pregnancy can cut down the risk significantly!  **How Does Aspirin Work?** Doctors believe that aspirin helps protect against preeclampsia because it prevents certain changes in the body that contribute to its development. **Important Information About Taking Aspirin:**  * **Benefits:** Taking aspirin may help reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia and deliver healthy baby. * **Side Effects:** Like any medication, aspirin can cause mild side effects like stomach upset, heartburn, or indigestion. There’s also a small possibility of minor bleeding. But these side effects are usually temporary and don't affect most people. * **Serious Side Effects:** We want to assure you that studies haven't shown any increase in dangerous problems like bleeding in the uterus or brain bleedings in.", "ids": 0.414, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}

Select papers relevant to CV or NLP specializations depending on chosen focus area. *  **Focus on real-world examples**: Analyze how these concepts apply to common ML tasks within CV or NLp fields. Look for case studies and tutorials demonstrating their implementation. **Day  4-7: Deep Learning Fundamentals & Hands-On Experience**  * **Deep dive into Fast. AI:** Continue progressing through the fast. ai Practical Deep learning course, dedicating time to understand key architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks(RNNs). Apply learned concepts to solve sample datasets available on Kaggle. *  **Explore Open Source Projects:** Engage with existing codebases related to your chosen specialization. Identify potential contributions or bug fixes. Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git. **Day8-9: Specialization Selection &.", "ids": 0.4448, "conflict_would_trigger": false, "intent_elaborated": true}
