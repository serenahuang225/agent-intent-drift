    "article": "The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to ban a wide range of single-use plastics, a landmark move aimed squarely at reducing marine and terrestrial pollution. The approved legislation, backed by 571 MEPs with 53 against, will outlaw items including plastic cutlery, plates, straws, cotton bud sticks, polystyrene food and drink containers, and oxo-degradable plastics by 2021. Furthermore, it sets an ambitious extended producer responsibility scheme and a binding target for member states to collect 90% of single-use plastic beverage bottles by 2025, primarily through deposit-return systems. Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella hailed the vote, stating it \"will help Europe transition to a circular economy and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\" Campaigners from the Rethink Plastic alliance described it as a vital blow against a plastic tide that sees an estimated 8 million tonnes enter the world's oceans annually. The law also introduces stringent labelling requirements for sanitary products and wet wipes, and mandates that plastic bottles contain at least 30% recycled content by 2030.",

    "article": "A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the ASPRE trial) was conducted across 13 maternity hospitals to assess the efficacy of daily low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women identified as high-risk by first-trimester screening. 1,776 participants with singleton pregnancies were randomly assigned to receive either 150mg of aspirin or an identical placebo orally each night from 11-14 weeks of gestation until 36 weeks or delivery. The primary outcome was delivery with preeclampsia before 37 weeks' gestation (preterm preeclampsia). Secondary outcomes included term preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and adverse neonatal outcomes. The aspirin group demonstrated a significant 62% reduction in the relative risk of preterm preeclampsia (1.6% incidence vs 4.3% in the placebo group; relative risk 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74; P=0.004). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of preterm preeclampsia was 37. The incidence of term preeclampsia was not significantly different. Crucially, the incidence of serious adverse events, including placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, or fetal intracranial hemorrhage, did not differ significantly between groups. The study concludes that low-dose aspirin (150mg) initiated in the late first trimester and maintained until late pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of preterm preeclampsia in high-risk women, with a favorable safety profile.",

    "article": "Review 1 (5 stars): 'Absolutely stellar battery life. I consistently get 28-30 hours of mixed use with ANC on, which obliterates my old set. The noise cancellation is magical on flights—it turns the cabin roar into a gentle hum. The transparency mode is also incredibly natural for office chats.' Review 2 (4 stars): 'The fit and comfort are top-tier. I wear these for 8-hour workdays without any ear fatigue. Sound quality for music is rich and detailed, with a wide soundstage. The voice call quality, however, is just average. My clients consistently say I sound a bit distant or 'in a can,' even in a quiet room. The multipoint connection to my laptop and phone is genius but finicky.' Review 3 (2 stars): 'Deal-breaking connectivity. Drops Bluetooth connection with my 2023 MacBook Pro multiple times a day, requiring a full reset. The touch controls are far too sensitive—adjusting my glasses triggers pause/play. The companion app is barebones and crashed twice during firmware updates, which is unacceptable for a premium product.' Review 4 (3 stars): 'The build quality feels phenomenal—metal hinges, premium plastics. But the software undermines it all. The app's EQ presets are negligible, and creating a custom profile is unintuitive. For this $350 price tag, I expected flawless software integration, not this buggy afterthought. ANC and sound are good, but not class-leading as advertised.' Review 5 (5 stars): 'Worth every penny for the audio purist. The sound signature is beautifully balanced out of the box. The seamless switching between my iPhone and Windows PC works perfectly 95% of the time, a true productivity booster. After six months, the ear pads are still like new. This is my endgame headset for music and focus work.'",
